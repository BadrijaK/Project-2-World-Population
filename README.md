## Abstract

The goal for this project was to find recent data for the world population – by country, as well as data regarding the area of countries to determine which are the most densely populated countries and regions in the world. After selecting an appropriate data source, the data was then cleaned as needed and loaded onto a database. In this case, into a relational database of our choice – SQL. After extracting and loading, we then used the data to answer our main question as well as others, all of which are outlined below.

## Production Database
